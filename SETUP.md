## Installing Hyprland (From Existing DE)

If you already have a desktop environment installed (e.g., Endeavour OS with KDE or GNOME), you can install Hyprland alongside it. This guide will walk you through the process.

### Prerequisites

- An existing desktop environment (e.g., Endeavour OS)
- Root or sudo access
- Basic familiarity with terminal commands

> **⚠️ Note for VM Users:** If you're running this in a virtual machine, make sure **3D acceleration is enabled** in your VM settings before launching Hyprland.

---

### Step 1: Switch to TTY

At the login screen, you need to switch to a virtual terminal (TTY) to install Hyprland without interference from your current desktop environment.

1. At the login screen, press **`Ctrl + Alt + F2`**
2. You'll be presented with a text-based login prompt
3. Log in with your username and password

> **💡 Tip:** If you need to return to your graphical login screen later, press `Ctrl + Alt + F1` or `Ctrl + Alt + F7`.

---

### Step 2: Update System Packages

Before installing new software, it's always a good practice to update your system:

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

This command:
- Updates the package database
- Upgrades all installed packages to their latest versions

Wait for the update to complete before proceeding.

---

### Step 3: Install Hyprland

Install Hyprland and its dependencies:

```bash
sudo pacman -S hyprland
```

Confirm the installation when prompted by typing `Y` and pressing Enter.

---

### Step 4: Install Essential Terminal Emulators and Tools

Install terminal emulators and essential tools:

```bash
sudo pacman -S foot kitty vim
```

These packages include:
- **foot**: Lightweight Wayland terminal emulator (recommended for Hyprland)
- **kitty**: Modern, feature-rich terminal emulator
- **vim**: Text editor for configuration files

---

### Step 5: Configure Hyprland

Now you need to configure Hyprland to use your preferred terminal emulator and display settings.

#### 5.1. Open the Hyprland Configuration File

```bash
vim ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
```

> **💡 Vim Quick Reference:**
> - Press `i` to enter INSERT mode (to edit)
> - Press `Esc` to exit INSERT mode
> - Type `:wq` and press Enter to save and quit
> - Type `:q!` and press Enter to quit without saving

#### 5.2. Disable Auto-generated Config

Find the line that says:

```
autogenerated = 1
```

Either delete this line or comment it out by adding a `#` at the beginning:

```
# autogenerated = 1
```

#### 5.3. Change Default Terminal Emulator

Find the line that defines the terminal variable (usually near the top of the file):

```
$terminal = kitty
```

Change it to use `foot` instead:

```
$terminal = foot
```

> **💡 Tip:** You can use whichever terminal emulator you prefer. This guide uses `foot` as it's lightweight and optimized for Wayland.

#### 5.4. Update Monitor Configuration

Find the monitor configuration line and update it to match your display settings:

```
monitor = ,1920x1080@60,auto,1.33
```

This configuration:
- Uses a resolution of 1920x1080 at 60Hz
- Auto-positions the monitor
- Sets a scale factor of 1.33

> **💡 Tip:** Adjust the resolution and scale factor based on your monitor's native resolution and your preference. Common scale factors:
> - `1.0` = 100% (no scaling)
> - `1.25` = 125% scaling
> - `1.33` = 133% scaling
> - `1.5` = 150% scaling

#### 5.5. Save and Exit

After making these changes:
1. Press `Esc` to exit INSERT mode
2. Type `:wq` and press Enter to save and quit

---

### Step 6: Launch Hyprland

Now you can launch Hyprland from the TTY:

```bash
Hyprland
```

Hyprland should start, and you'll see your new tiling window manager environment!

> **⚠️ VM Users:** If Hyprland fails to start or you see graphical glitches, ensure 3D acceleration is enabled in your VM settings, then try again.

---

### Step 7: Open a Terminal in Hyprland

Once Hyprland has launched, you can open a terminal using the keyboard shortcut:

Press **`Super + Q`** (where `Super` is the Windows key)

This will open your configured terminal emulator (foot, based on our configuration).

---

## Essential Applications

### Installing Firefox

With Hyprland running and a terminal open, you can install Firefox:

```bash
sudo pacman -S firefox
```

After installation, you can launch Firefox from the terminal:

```bash
firefox
```

Or add it to your Hyprland keybindings for quick access.

---

## Useful Hyprland Keyboard Shortcuts

Here are some default Hyprland keyboard shortcuts to get you started:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Super + Q` | Open terminal |
| `Super + C` | Close focused window |
| `Super + M` | Exit Hyprland |
| `Super + V` | Toggle floating mode |
| `Super + F` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Super + [1-9]` | Switch to workspace 1-9 |
| `Super + Shift + [1-9]` | Move window to workspace 1-9 |
| `Super + Mouse Left` | Move window |
| `Super + Mouse Right` | Resize window |

> **💡 Tip:** You can customize all keyboard shortcuts in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`. Check the [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Hyprland Won't Start

```bash
# Check Hyprland logs
cat /tmp/hypr/*/hyprland.log

# Ensure you have necessary graphics drivers installed
# For NVIDIA:
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils

# For AMD:
sudo pacman -S mesa xf86-video-amdgpu

# For Intel:
sudo pacman -S mesa xf86-video-intel
```

### Issue: Terminal Won't Open with Super + Q

Check your configuration file:

```bash
vim ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf
```

Verify the terminal binding is present:

```
bind = SUPER, Q, exec, $terminal
```

And verify `$terminal` is set correctly.

### Issue: Display Resolution is Wrong

Edit the monitor configuration in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`:

```
# List available resolutions
hyprctl monitors

# Update the monitor line with your preferred resolution
monitor = ,1920x1080@60,auto,1
```
